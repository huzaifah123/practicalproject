# Introduction
 In this project I developed a parrallax website for a restaurant called 'Grill House', this included a responsive navigation bar for the users, a variety of images with css styling, videos and others to allow users to interact with. languages such as css/css3, html, and Javascript were implemented for the finished product.

Above are the sketches for the the desktop version, I ensured I started developing the website mobile first and included features that would be suitable for the desktop or mobile. For example, adding animations to desktop rather than mobile device or, changing the font size for the mobile device so the text seems smaller and more suitable for the mobile device.

Test cases:
1) tested if navigation works properly when resizing and should turn into a hamburger menu.
 = this worked perfectly as media query was used to ensure responsivness.
 
2) tested if the arrow animation worked.
= unfortunately from gaining feedback and the link to the animation did not work however, the animation itself was working perfectly fine.

3) tested if the parallax effect was working and to see whether the parallax would stop working on mobile device.
= this worked according to the people that had tested this.

4) tested if the text size was suitable for the mobile device
= this worked as i ensured the mobile device was suitable for the actual font size

5) Tested if the contact page form validates or not.
= this worked accordingly as messages appear when the user misses a required field or icon out.

# compatibility
This site is responsive for mobile, desktop and tablet and also works on all browsers such as mozilla firefox, google chrome, and safari.
This is also tested on devices such as iphone, samsung and tablets to see whether or not the website is compatible and responsive for the users to interact with
